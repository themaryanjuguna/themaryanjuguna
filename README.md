### WordPress Designer • Front-End Developer • Product Thinker

I build **accessible, human-centered digital products** where design, engineering, and real life actually meet.

## About Me

I’m a **WordPress Designer and Front-End Developer** with 6+ years in design and WordPress, and growing depth in modern front-end development.

I focus on building products that are:
- performance-conscious  
- accessibility-aware  
- emotionally intelligent (yes, that’s a thing)

Some projects are client-facing.  
Some are experimental.  
Some exist because the current tools simply aren’t humane enough.

## How My Projects Are Organized

I work across **three clear lanes** to stay intentional:

### Personal / Professional
Production-ready work, client projects, and polished tools. This is where reliability lives.

### ScatterBrain Hub
A **product lab** for experimental ideas and non-health apps. Exploration without pressure — but with structure.

### 🌙 Usingizi Initiative
Mission-driven work focused on:
- sleep health  
- neurological conditions  
- awareness through technology  

Different lanes. One builder.

## 🌍 Why I Build This Way

I live with **narcolepsy**, a neurological sleep disorder.

That experience deeply informs how I think about:
- fatigue-aware interfaces  
- humane defaults  
- flexibility over grind culture  
- designing tools that respect human limits  

Good software shouldn’t punish people for being human.
